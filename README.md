# Loss_function
# I prepare 2 "arrays" as "y_pred and y_true" 
# Now I create function "mean_absolute_value" and I put into "y_true, y_pred"
# This function will be calculate absolute difference between my true value and predicted value
# First i define "total_error", then I make for loop with comperhented list with (y_true, y_pred) using "zip" It will give one value from this two arrays
